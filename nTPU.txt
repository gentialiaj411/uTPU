UART Module



2x2 MAC Array:
    Has a accumulate resgister inside storing weights
    Every clock it takes its inputs, multiplies them and
    adds to the accumulated value passed to it
    This output is then sent down the array 
    Can be put into modes to load weights


Quantizer:
    The int16 output from the MAC array will be quantized 
    into a int4. 

    [-32768, 32767] -> [-8, 7]

    All this does is >> 12


LeakyReLU Unit:
    Takes the int8 output of the Quantizer and performs ReLU
    
    leakyReLU = x if x>0 else ax

    a is stored in a register in the unit
