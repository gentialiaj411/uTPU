# R3 progress

## Chunk 1 — GEMV

- Built `rtl/decode/gemv_unit.sv`: registered 16-lane INT4/INT8 stream GEMV shell,
  nibble unpack, INT32 accumulation, start/done and weight valid/ready handshakes.
- Runner: `python tools/decode/run_gemv_rtl.py`; planned cases are 224 real vectors
  and 2,000 random/edge vectors. Artifact records `not_run` because `iverilog` is
  absent in this environment; no RTL mismatch claim is made.
- Open issue: execute the runner with iverilog and complete exact scale/requant
  wiring before sign-off.

## Chunk 2 — vector units

- Added registered start/done shells for act quant, RMSNorm, RoPE, SiLU/mul, and
  residual units in `rtl/decode/vector_units.sv`.
- Runner emits 2,000 real + 2,000 random planned cases per unit. All five artifacts
  explicitly record `not_run` because iverilog is unavailable; no mismatches are claimed.
